I am a Geospatial Data Scientist and Remote Sensing Analyst with a Ph.D. in Data Science from the  [School of Digital Science](https://sds.ubd.edu.bn/), [Universiti Brunei Darussalam](https://ubd.edu.bn/). My research focused on using satellite imagery, geospatial analytics, and deep learning techniques to model and predict environmental phenomena, particularly wildfire spread and susceptibility.

His expertise includes Geospatial data science, remote sensing image processing and classification, image segmentation, feature extraction, ecological informatics, machine learning, deep learning-based networks, and environmental and natural hazard modeling using Earth observation data. In addition to his work in environmental data science, he has contributed to research in visual question answering, knowledge graphs, and graph neural networks. 

Iâ€™m passionate about harnessing Earth observation and AI technologies to address real-world environmental challenges, support sustainable development, and drive impactful decision-making.
