According to the author, the book is inspired by a set of the Toltec people's spiritual beliefs. The intent of the book is to help readers explore "freedom," "happiness," and "love."

The central point of the book is that a person's life is determined by agreements they have made with themselves, with others, with God, and with society as a whole. Through these agreements, one determines how they see themselves, what is possible for them, how they should behave, and their worth as a person.

The book is organized via explorations of the four agreements:

"Be impeccable with your word"
"Do not take anything personally"
"Do not make assumptions"
"Always do your best"

Chapters include the relevant linguistic and historical context for each topic. Ruiz says that by making a pact with the agreements described in the book, the individual is able to create a happier and more successful life.
