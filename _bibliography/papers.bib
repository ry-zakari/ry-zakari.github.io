  abstract={Wildfire spread prediction is critical for mitigating risks and improving management strategies. This study uses next-day weather forecasts and terrain features to enhance the Next Day Wildfire Spread (NDWS) dataset, initially designed for wildfire spread modeling. This enriched dataset spans from July 2015 to October 2024, incorporating forecast variables such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, slope, and aspect to complement existing elevation data. Leveraging this enriched dataset, we propose the Atrous Pyramid Attention U-Net (APAU-Net). This modified U-Net-based architecture combines Atrous Spatial Pyramid Convolution (ASPC) blocks and convolutional attention mechanisms to improve feature extraction and segmentation accuracy. The results demonstrate that APAU-Net, trained on the enhanced dataset, achieved an F1 Score of 0.720 and a mIoU of 0.635 on 64 × 64 resolution, and an F1 Score of 0.689 and mean Intersection over Union (mloU) of 0.605 on 32 × 32 resolution. These results demonstrate notable improvements compared to prior studies and existing methods. Comprehensive ablation studies were then conducted using APAU-Net to evaluate the contributions of different feature groups, revealing the importance of integrating weather, topography, and previous fire activity for accurate predictions. Additionally, Integrated Gradients were utilized to provide interpretability for the model's decisions, offering an understanding of the significance of each feature in the prediction process. The computational efficiency of APAU-Net was also evaluated, showing a significant reduction in training time compared to previous models, making it a viable solution for real-time applications. The APAU-Net model provides an effective approach for predicting the next day's wildfire spread, providing a valuable tool for improving wildfire risk management and response strategies in the face of increasingly complex wildfire behavior.},

  abstract={We address the problem of unsupervised disentanglement of latent representations learnt via deep generative models. In contrast to current approaches that operate on the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we argue that statistical independence in the latent space of VAEs can be enforced in a principled hierarchical Bayesian manner. To this effect, we augment the standard VAE with an inverse-Wishart (IW) prior on the covariance matrix of the latent code. By tuning the IW parameters, we are able to encourage (or discourage) independence in the learnt latent dimensions. Extensive experimental results on a range of datasets (2DShapes, 3DChairs, 3DFaces and CelebA) show our approach to outperform the β-VAE and is competitive with the state-of-the-art FactorVAE. Our approach achieves significantly better disentanglement and reconstruction on a new dataset (CorrelatedEllipses) which introduces correlations between the factors of variation.},
