The intent of the book is to help readers explore “freedom,” “happiness,” and “love.”</p> <p>The central point of the book is that a person’s life is determined by agreements they have made with themselves, with others, with God, and with society as a whole. Through these agreements, one determines how they see themselves, what is possible for them, how they should behave, and their worth as a person.</p> <p>The book is organized via explorations of the four agreements:</p> <p>“Be impeccable with your word” “Do not take anything personally” “Do not make assumptions” “Always do your best”</p> <p>Chapters include the relevant linguistic and historical context for each topic. Ruiz says that by making a pact with the agreements described in the book, the individual is able to create a happier and more successful life.</p> </body></html>
